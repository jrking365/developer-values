  Git commit message strategy
</h1>

* The message body has to be prefixed with the corresponding Jira ticket if available.
* The message body should explain how the code was altered from a business/technical point of view. 
  It should not describe how X file has been modified.
* These rules only applies for commit messages into the main brancgh (master, develop).
