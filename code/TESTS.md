## Write Tests

Despite seeming like writing tests slow down development, it speeds up overall development because it
significantly reduces the danger of future changes, and add resourceful approach on the code logic, meaning we can ship future changes quicker and
with greater confidence.

## Build testable and well tested code

Test that the functionality or the changes introduce behaves as expected and fulfills the requirements. Also make sure that you didn't introduce regressions.

Every functionality or correction should be accompanied by basic unit tests and whenever possible integrations tests.
