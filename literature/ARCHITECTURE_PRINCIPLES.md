# Architecture Principles

## 1- Keep it super simple

// avoid moving parts, use less dependencies, workers, CRONs, external processes, if it can be avoided

## 2- Informed decisions

// avoid premature optimization, premature decoupling. monitor your outcome, run perf testing, make data-driven decisions

## 3- Team-oriented

// is the code understandable and easy to survey, are there strange patterns or hidden logic/config. is knowledge shared (bus factor), hows the documentation, comments linting

## 4- Know the risks

// is the code tested, is the environement controlled, replicable and reliable. is there ci/cd, code reviews
