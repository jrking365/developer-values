  Paired Code Review
</h1>

At Pillar, we highly encourage the practice of Paired Code Review.

## Benefits

The main advantage of practicing paired code review is the ability of the reviewer to get instant feedback from the 
developer when he requires clarifications on a piece of code. This ceremony provides the following benefits as well:

* Efficient way to do knowledge sharing.
* Good method to improve developer growth.
* Great tool for developer on-boarding.
* Neat way to promote good practices & culture
* Efficient way to teach developer on how to do code review.
* Good method to improve team spirit.

## Good Practices

In order to execute paired code review properly, the following guidelines should be followed:

* Code review corrections should be done on the spot by the reviewing team.
* Always stay respectful toward our colleagues and their work.

## When Should We Practice It?

Situations where paired code reviews should be promoted:

* First code review(s) for a new developer.
* First code review for a new project (repository).
* When the size of the Pull Request is quite large.

## Pull Request Approval Process

Our current approval process for pull request remains the same. An approval from a “paired review” team only counts 
as 1 approval.
