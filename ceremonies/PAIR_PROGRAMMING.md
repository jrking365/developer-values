  Pair Programming
</h1>

At Pillar, we highly encourage the practice of Pair Programming.

## Benefits

Here is a list of many benefits and advantages of doing pair programming:

* Two heads are usually better than one to solve a problem.
* Results in fewer coding mistake having two developers live-reviewing the code.
* Great process to promote best practices
* Good method to improve developer growth.
* Efficient way to do knowledge sharing.
* Great tool for developer on-boarding.
* Good method to improve team spirit.

## Good Practices

In order to execute pair programming properly, the following guidelines should be followed:

* Always stay respectful toward our colleagues and their work.
* Don't push it. If any of the developer is not in the mood or is too tired, the process will not succeed. 

## When Should We Practice It?

Situations where pair programming should be promoted:

* When stuck on a problem and need help to figure out this issue.
* When working on a large task.
* When on-boarding a new developer.
* When used as a teachable moment to share knowledge and best practices.

When you are interested to do pair programming for a specific task, express you desire to do so in the daily ceremonies,
or contact directly another developer to see if he/she is interested.
